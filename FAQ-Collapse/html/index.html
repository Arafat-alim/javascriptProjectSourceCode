        <h3 class="faq-title">What Are APIs?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          Put simply, APIs allow two or more systems to share data with each
          other, giving you new ways to consume and interact with your shipments
          and supply chain. APIs allow users to search for specific types of
          data, take action, or be notified of changes in status. Due to the
          real-time nature of APIs and the ability to centralize data from
          multiple systems, users of APIs can make decisions with the latest
          data, reducing delay and guess work. You likely interact with APIs
          every day; they are used by your car, television, phone, and smart
          home devices. APIs are used to integrate systems together for improved
          responsiveness, by exchanging information real-time.

        <h3 class="faq-title">When Should I Use a Union Pacific API?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          TWhen determining where to best use APIs, you should first start by
          identifying what data would be most useful to have real-time access
          to, within your system. Today, you may be manually looking up the
          latest information on a shipment from our website, or check if a
          service issue (or case) has been updated. Second, you should think
          about the actions you take to manage your shipments, like such as
          release, order in, etc. Using an API in these scenarios can get you
          the data you need, when you need it, and give you the ability to act
          upon it without having to leave your own system. While Union Pacific
          will be releasing our first suite of services later this year, we plan
          on continuing to add new functionality and services through additional
          releases.

          What will be included in the latest version of services released?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          Union Pacific’s API services are structured in data objects, or
          building blocks. These objects can be used as stand-alone services or
          combined to create more robust processes. In specification review, our
          team will work with you and help discuss ways you could use these
          services in your business. Shipment – The shipment interface give the
          requestor the ability to search their active shipments by a variety of
          filters and get latest details on ETA/ETG, Planned UP Events, and
          Offline Events. Shipment Actions – The shipment actions interface will
          give the request the ability to order in, release, cancel, and view
          request history for a customer’s location. Case – The case interface
          gives the requestor the ability to find the latest details on cases
          related to their shipment. Equipment – The equipment interface gives
          the requester the ability to search through and identify equipment
          based on the equipment specifications. Location – The location
          interface gives the requestor the ability to receive details about
          their company facilities on the Union Pacific network. Account – The
          account interface gives the requester the ability to receive the
          latest details about their company or companies under their account
          hierarchy. Waybill - The waybill interface gives the requestor the
          ability to lookup waybill details for a single waybill or multiple
          waybills. Intermodal APIs – These API services will focus on the
          processes in the intermodal space including gate reservation and
          driver applications (UPGo). General Services – The General Services
          interface allows the users to track active shipments for ETA and
          current location information.

        <h3 class="faq-title">What Are the Types of APIs?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          As you look through our documentation you will see two different
          styles of APIs: resource (/shipment) and RPC (/releaseShipment). These
          styles are used to simplify the use and interaction with our APIs. The
          resource style APIs are used primarily for data reading and
          exploration. This style allows the caller to search through data and
          understand the relationship between it. The relationship between data
          should follow a logical business model (e.g., locations have tracks,
          and tracks have equipment). This helps with discovery and makes it
          easier to find the data you need. RPC style APIs are best used for
          taking action. The naming of these APIs mirrors this with a style. An
          example use case of these two styles used together occurs when a
          customer searches through rail cars to easily find the cars that they
          would like to order in to their industry.
